The two lists in project_preproess files are

1.	The list with 0 and 1 values for the corresponding comments.

2.	The list of list of all words.

When you'll run the file, they both will get printed, see the results.

Check if they are fitting without any errors in countVectorizer and it is working.

TO DO:

1.	Since all the stopwords have been removed, we have to allow some words to be there (as discussed).
	We'll see this later. First we need a basic working model (maybe with low precision but atleast working.)
